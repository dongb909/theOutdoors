-ejs
	-js code and variable access from view folder objs goes btwn <% %> aka ejs brackets
	-Even when doing src="<%%>" even if that variable returns a string the quotes won't come with it
	-<%- for including variables
	-<%= for allowing html tags (just have to run a filter for scripts)
	
	
- app.set("view engine", "ejs") ==> configuration info telling express to set its key "view engine" to ejs, or pug or something else. Basically all the html we're doing, we're going to be using ejs


-//.populate adds the actual comments to our objs instead of the ids references
//.exec is a function that lets you execute your own code after a promise is returned

-if using async/await then the above methods will not work bc you're no longer using promises.
